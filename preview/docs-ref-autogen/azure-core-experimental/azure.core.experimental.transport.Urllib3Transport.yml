  summary: 'Sleep for the specified duration.


    You should always ask the transport to sleep, and not call directly

    the stdlib. This is mostly important in async, as the transport

    may not use asyncio but other implementations like trio and they have their own

    way to sleep, but to keep design

    consistent, it''s cleaner to always ask the transport to sleep and let the transport

    implementor decide how to do it.'
