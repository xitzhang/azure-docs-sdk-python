summary: 'How the import job will handle conflicts. For example, if the import job
  is trying to bring in

  a directory, but a file is at that path, how it handles it. Fail indicates that
  the import job

  should stop immediately and not do anything with the conflict. Skip indicates that
  it should

  pass over the conflict. OverwriteIfDirty causes the import job to delete and re-import
  the file

  or directory if it is a conflicting type, is dirty, or was not previously imported.

  OverwriteAlways extends OverwriteIfDirty to include releasing files that had been
  restored but

  were not dirty. Please reference [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-managed-lustre/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-managed-lustre/)

  for a thorough explanation of these resolution modes.'
